Studying at the University of Oklahoma, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2019, and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2020, with minors in physics and math. I spend my days in class, working as a research assistant for the Center for Autonomous Sensing and Sampling, and volunteering with Student Heroes. Some of my other pursuits include work within the physics department to refurbish an ultra-high vacuum (for use in thin film deposition), and my capstone project at the Science Museum Oklahoma.
